# Detect-HoneyPot-Using-PowerShell

How to Know if this Device is Physical or not Physical {Virtual} on Windows Environments. 

It Was The First Task at The Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI

This script only works on Windows devices

As a Penetration Tester We use scripts like that to identify the device which I have interacting with Is it a Physical device or a HoneyPot 

Knowing the device you are dealing with is very important during the Penetration Testing process 
There is also WinPEAS, A script that searches for possible paths to escalate privileges on Windows hosts.
 When you use WinPEAS, you will notice that there is a section to determine whether the devices are real or HoneyPot

So It's an Important Step you should know as a Pentester.


If you have reached this point I would like to say thank you
